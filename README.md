- "Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning." - Rich Cook

This quote highlights the ongoing challenge programmers face in creating user-friendly and robust software, while also acknowledging the ever-increasing complexity of technology and the potential for users to misuse or misunderstand it. It serves as a reminder to continually strive for simplicity and clarity in our code, while also being mindful of the potential limitations and vulnerabilities of our creations.

- "Today's programming wisdom is to write code that is clear and easy to understand, rather than overly complex and difficult to read. This means using descriptive variable names, writing concise and well-structured functions, and commenting your code thoroughly. Remember, code is written once but read many times, so make it easy for others (and your future self) to follow your logic and understand your code."
